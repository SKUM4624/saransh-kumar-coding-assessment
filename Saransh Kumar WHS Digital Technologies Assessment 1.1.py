## will be making a program where you ask questions to the computer and it responds back with different answers and questions.
QUESTIONS = {
    "When was the first known use of the word 'quiz'": [
        "1781", "1771", "1871", "1881"

        "input", "get", "print", "write"
    ],
    "Which keyword do you use to loop over a given list of elements": [
        "for", "while", "each", "loop"
    ],
    "What's the purpose of the built-in zip() function": [
        "To iterate over two or more sequences at the same time",
        "To combine several strings into one",
        "To compress several files into one archive",
        "To get information from the user",
    ],
}

name = input("What's your name? ") # Asks name of player

for question, alternatives in QUESTIONS.items():
    correct_answer = alternatives[0]
    for alternative in sorted(alternatives):
        print(f"  - {alternative}")

    if answer == correct_answer:
        print("Correct!")
    else:
        print(f"The answer is {correct_answer!r}, not {answer!r}")
