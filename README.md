This repository hosts an app that I, Saransh Kumar am making for a Digital Technologies assignment where we have to create an educational program or game. I am making a quiz app in Python. This repository contains all the documentary of this app. I have programmed this quiz program in Visual Studio Code, a coding editor. I will use Replit so that anyone can directly run the program from their browser without having to download anything else externally.
