This repository hosts an app that I, Saransh Kumar am making for a Digital Technologies assignment where we have to create an educational program or game. I am making a quiz app in Python. This repository contains all the documentary of this app. I have programmed this quiz program in Visual Studio Code, a coding editor. The actual code itself and my Git commits both have documentation and descriptions of my work.
